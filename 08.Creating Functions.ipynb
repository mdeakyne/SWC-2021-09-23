    "## Testing and Documenting\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we start putting things in functions so that we can re-use them,\n",

    "let's use NumPy to create a matrix of 0's\n",

    "```Python\n",
    "z = numpy.zeros((2,2))\n",
    "print(offset_mean(z, 3))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That looks right,\n",
    "so let's try `offset_mean` on our real data:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "data = numpy.loadtxt(fname='inflammation-01.csv', delimiter=',')\n",
    "print(offset_mean(data, 0))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It's hard to tell from the default output whether the result is correct,\n",
    "but there are a few tests that we can run to reassure us:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "print('original min, mean, and max are:', numpy.min(data), numpy.mean(data), numpy.max(data))\n",
    "offset_data = offset_mean(data, 0)\n",
    "print('min, mean, and max of offset data are:',\n",

    "      numpy.mean(offset_data),\n",
    "      numpy.max(offset_data))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "That seems almost right:\n",
    "the original mean was about 6.1,\n",
    "so the lower bound from zero is now about -6.1.\n",
    "The mean of the offset data isn't quite zero --- we'll explore why not in the challenges --- but\n",
    "it's pretty close.\n",
    "We can even go further and check that the standard deviation hasn't changed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "print('std dev before and after:', numpy.std(data), numpy.std(offset_data))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Those values look the same,\n",
    "but we probably wouldn't notice if they were different in the sixth decimal place.\n",
    "Let's do this instead:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "print('difference in standard deviations before and after:',\n",
    "      numpy.std(data) - numpy.std(offset_data))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Again,\n",
    "the difference is very small.\n",
    "It's still possible that our function is wrong,\n",
    "but it seems unlikely enough that we should probably get back to doing our analysis.\n",
    "We have one more task first, though:\n",
    "we should write some __documentation__ for our function\n",
    "to remind ourselves later what it's for and how to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The usual way to put documentation in software is\n",
    "to add __comments__ like this:\n",

    "```Python\n",
    "# offset_mean(data, target_mean_value):\n",
    "# return a new array containing the original data with its mean offset to match the desired value.\n",

    "    return (data - numpy.mean(data)) + target_mean_value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a better way, though.\n",
    "If the first thing in a function is a string that isn't assigned to a variable,\n",
    "that string is attached to the function as its documentation:\n",

    "\n",

    "help(offset_mean)\n",

    "\n",
    "A string like this is called a __docstring__.\n",
    "We don't need to use triple quotes when we write one,\n",

    "\n",

    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    return (data - numpy.mean(data)) + target_mean_value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The key change is that the second parameter is now written `target_mean_value=0.0`\n",
    "instead of just `target_mean_value`.\n",
    "If we call the function with two arguments,\n",
    "it works as it did before:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "test_data = numpy.zeros((2, 2))\n",
    "print(offset_mean(test_data, 3))\n",

    "print('two parameters:')\n",
    "display(55, 66)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As this example shows,\n",
    "parameters are matched up from left to right,\n",
    "and any that haven't been given a value explicitly get their default value.\n",
