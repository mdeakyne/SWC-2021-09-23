    " ## Variables as Sticky Notes\n",

    " weight_lb = 2.2 * weight_kg\n",

    " ```\n",
    " Similar to above, the expression `2.2 * weight_kg` is evaluated to `143.0`,\n",
    " and then this value is assigned to the variable `weight_lb` (i.e. the sticky\n",
    " note `weight_lb` is placed on `143.0`). At this point, each variable is\n",
    " \"stuck\" to completely distinct and unrelated values.\n",
    "\n",
    " Let's now change `weight_kg`:\n",
    "\n",
    " ```Python \n",
    " weight_kg = 100.0\n",
    " print('weight in kilograms is now:', weight_kg, 'and weight in pounds is still:', weight_lb)\n",
    " ```\n",
