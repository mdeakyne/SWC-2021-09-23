    "## Loading data into Python\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin processing inflammation data, we need to load it into Python.\n",
    "We can do that using a library called\n",
    "[NumPy](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/ \"NumPy Documentation\"), which stands for Numerical Python.\n",
    "In general, you should use this library when you want to do fancy things with lots of numbers,\n",
    "especially if you have matrices or arrays. To tell Python that we'd like to start using NumPy,\n",
    "we need to __import__ it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "import numpy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Importing a library is like getting a piece of lab equipment out of a storage locker and setting it\n",
    "up on the bench. Libraries provide additional functionality to the basic Python package, much like\n",
    "a new piece of equipment adds functionality to a lab space. Just like in the lab, importing too\n",
    "many libraries can sometimes complicate and slow down your programs - so we only import what we\n",
    "need for each program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we've imported the library, we can ask the library to read our data file for us:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "numpy.loadtxt(fname='inflammation-01.csv', delimiter=',')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The expression `numpy.loadtxt(...)` is a\n",
    "__function call__\n",
    "that asks Python to run the __function__ `loadtxt` which\n",
    "belongs to the `numpy` library.\n",
    "This __dotted notation__\n",
    "is used everywhere in Python: the thing that appears before the dot contains the thing that\n",
    "appears after.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, John Smith is the John that belongs to the Smith family.\n",
    "We could use the dot notation to write his name `smith.john`,\n",
    "just as `loadtxt` is a function that belongs to the `numpy` library.\n",
    "\n",
    "`numpy.loadtxt` has two __parameters__: the name of the file\n",
    "we want to read and the __delimiter__ that separates values\n",
    "on a line. These both need to be character strings\n",
    "(or __strings__) for short), so we put them in quotes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we haven't told it to do anything else with the function's output,\n",
    "the __notebook__ displays it.\n",
    "In this case,\n",
    "that output is the data we just loaded.\n",
    "By default,\n",
    "only a few rows and columns are shown\n",
    "(with `...` to omit elements when displaying big arrays).\n",
    "Note that, to save space when displaying NumPy arrays, Python does not show us trailing zeros,\n",
    "so `1.0` becomes `1.`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our call to `numpy.loadtxt` read our file\n",
    "but didn't save the data in memory.\n",
    "To do that,\n",
    "we need to assign the array to a variable. In a similar manner to how we assign a single\n",
    "value to a variable, we can also assign an array of values to a variable using the same syntax.\n",
    "Let's re-run `numpy.loadtxt` and save the returned data:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "data = numpy.loadtxt(fname='inflammation-01.csv', delimiter=',')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement doesn't produce any output because we've assigned the output to the variable `data`.\n",
    "If we want to check that the data have been loaded,\n",
    "we can print the variable's value:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "print(data)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now that the data are in memory,\n",
    "we can manipulate them.\n",
    "First,\n",
    "let's ask what [type]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#type) of thing `data` refers to:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output tells us that `data` currently refers to\n",
    "an N-dimensional array, the functionality for which is provided by the NumPy library.\n",
    "These data correspond to arthritis patients' inflammation.\n",
    "The rows are the individual patients, and the columns\n",
    "are their daily inflammation measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " ## In the Corner\n",
    "\n",
    " What may also surprise you is that when Python displays an array,\n",
    " it shows the element with index `[0, 0]` in the upper left corner\n",
    " rather than the lower left.\n",
    " This is consistent with the way mathematicians draw matrices\n",
    " but different from the Cartesian coordinates.\n",
    " The indices are (row, column) instead of (column, row) for the same reason,\n",
    " which can be confusing when plotting data.\n",
