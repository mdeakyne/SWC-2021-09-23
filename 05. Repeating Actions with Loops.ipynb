    "In the episode about visualizing data,\n",
    "we wrote Python code that plots values of interest from our first\n",
    "inflammation dataset (`inflammation-01.csv`), which revealed some suspicious features in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a dozen data sets right now, though, and more on the way.\n",
    "We want to create plots for all of our data sets with a single statement.\n",
    "To do that, we'll have to teach the computer how to repeat things.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example task that we might want to repeat is accessing numbers in a list,\n",
    "which we\n",
    "will do by printing each number on a line of its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "odds = [1, 3, 5, 7]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a list is basically an ordered collection of elements, and every\n",
    "element has a unique number associated with it --- its index. This means that\n",
    "we can access elements in a list using their indices.\n",
    "For example, we can get the first number in the list `odds`,\n",
    "by using `odds[0]`. One way to print each number is to use four `print` statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "print(odds[0])\n",
    "print(odds[1])\n",
    "print(odds[2])\n",
    "print(odds[3])\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is a bad approach for three reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Not scalable**. Imagine you need to print a list that has hundreds\n",
    "    of elements.  It might be easier to type them in manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Difficult to maintain**. If we want to decorate each printed element with an\n",
    "    asterisk or any other character, we would have to change four lines of code. While\n",
    "    this might not be a problem for small lists, it would definitely be a problem for\n",
    "    longer ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Fragile**. If we use it with a list that has more elements than what we initially\n",
    "    envisioned, it will only display part of the list's elements. A shorter list, on\n",
    "    the other hand, will cause an error because it will be trying to display elements of the\n",
    "    list that do not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "odds = [1, 3, 5]\n",
    "print(odds[0])\n",
    "print(odds[1])\n",
    "print(odds[2])\n",
    "print(odds[3])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a better approach: a __for loop__\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "odds = [1, 3, 5, 7]\n",
    "for num in odds:\n",
    "    print(num)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "odds = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]\n",
    "for num in odds:\n",
    "    print(num)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The improved version uses a __for loop__\n",
    "to repeat an operation --- in this case, printing --- once for each thing in a sequence.\n",
    "The general form of a loop is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "for variable in collection:\n",
    "    # do things using variable, such as print\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",

    "producing 1,\n",
    "and updates `length` to refer to that new value.\n",
    "The next time around,\n",
    "`value` is `Darwin` and `length` is 1,\n",
    "so `length` is updated to be 2.\n",
    "After one more update,\n",
    "`length` is 3;\n",
    "since there is nothing left in `names` for Python to process,\n",
    "the loop finishes\n",
    "and the `print` function on line 5 tells us our final answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that a loop variable is a variable that is being used to record progress in a loop.\n",
    "It still exists after the loop is over,\n",
    "and we can re-use variables previously defined as loop variables as well:\n",
    "\n",
