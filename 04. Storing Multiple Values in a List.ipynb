    "In the previous episode, we analyzed a single file with inflammation data. Our goal, however, is to\n",
    "process all the inflammation data we have, which means that we still have eleven more files to go!\n",
    "\n",
    "The natural first step is to collect the names of all the files that we have to process. In Python,\n",
    "a list is a way to store multiple values together. In this episode, we will learn how to store\n",
    "multiple values in a list as well as how to work with lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike NumPy arrays, lists are built into the language so we do not have to load a library\n",
    "to use them.\n",
    "We create a list by putting values inside square brackets and separating the values with commas:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "odds = [1, 3, 5, 7]\n",
    "print('odds are:', odds)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can access elements of a list using indices -- numbered positions of elements in the list.\n",
    "These positions are numbered starting at 0, so the first element has an index of 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "print('first element:', odds[0])\n",
    "print('last element:', odds[3])\n",
    "print('\"-1\" element:', odds[-1])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, we can use negative numbers as indices in Python. When we do so, the index `-1` gives us the\n",
    "last element in the list, `-2` the second to last, and so on.\n",
    "Because of this, `odds[3]` and `odds[-1]` point to the same element here.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one important difference between lists and strings:\n",
    "we can change the values in a list,\n",
    "but we cannot change individual characters in a string.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "names = ['Curie', 'Darwing', 'Turing']  # typo in Darwin's name\n",
    "print('names is originally:', names)\n",
    "names[1] = 'Darwin'  # correct the name\n",
    "print('final value of names:', names)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "works, but:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "name = 'Darwin'\n",
    "name[0] = 'd'\n",
    "```\n",
